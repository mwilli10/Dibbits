Elevator Pitch:
This app is meant to be an advanced to-do list that can be used by children, college students, and adults alike.  
This app is unique, because it allows the user to communicate tasks (dibbits) with their friends, family, and/or co-workers.  


Functional Description:
The application will hold a collection of "dibbits" (items on a to-do list), each of which will have many different properties. 
Examples of these properties include, "title, due_by_date, input_date, "energy commitment", description, location, etc.
The app will display the dibbits in at least two different views (list view and calendar view).  
Users will be reminded of their dibbits based on when they set reminders. 
Users can even share dibbits with their friends! 
This allows more than one user to have the same dibbit (great for group projects!).   


Technical Description:
The application makes use of the device's native features. 
The app uses SMS messaging to send dibbits to other users. 
Additionally, the app uses the in-house calendar as a starting point for the app's calendar view.
